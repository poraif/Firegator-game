# Firegator-game
My second programming assignment, completed March 2023. This is a simple game written in Java, which helped me to develop a deeper knowledge of implementing classes, objects, arrays, loops, and mouse/key event handling.

## Introduction
Get the fish swimming downstream before they pass you, while avoiding the logs! Shoot fireballs at fish, or bite them as they draw nearer for points, but lose a life if you hit a log.

## Setup 
1. Download Processing v4 here - https://processing.org/download
2. Download and unzip the files in this repository.
3. Open the files in Processing.
4. Enjoy!

## Gameplay
- Movement up/down/left/right - arrows keys
- Bite - press 'b' key when fish is in contact with gator
- Fire fireball - space bar

## Known bugs
1. Game reset - if gator moving when game over, when the game resets sometimes it keeps moving to the edge of the screen, but it moves normally after that.
2. Gator - log collision - imperfect, which can cause life to be lost without full collision, particularly when gator goes over top of log.
